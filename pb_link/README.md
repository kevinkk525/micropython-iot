# 0. IOT design for clients lacking a LAN interface

This uses an ESP8266 to provide a resilient "socket-like" link between a non
networked device (the client) and a server-side application. The ESP8266 runs a
fixed configuration. All client-side application code resides on the client.

Communication between the client and the ESP8266 uses I2C. The client must be
capable of running I2C slave mode. This includes STM boards such as the
Pyboard. In this doc the client device is referred to as the Pyboard.

# 1. Wiring

ESP8266 pin numbers are GPIO pins as used on the reference board. WeMos have
their own numbering scheme.

| Pyboard | ESP8266 | Notes    | WeMos pins |
|:-------:|:-------:|:--------:|:-----------|
|  gnd    |  gnd    |          |  gnd |
|  X9     |  0      | I2C scl  |  D3 |
|  X10    |  2      | I2C sda  |  D4 |
|  X11    |  5      | syn      |  D1 |
|  X12    |  rst    | reset    |  reset |
|  Y8     |  4      | ack      |  D2 |

Pyboard pins may be altered at will. The chosen pins enable hard I2C to be used
but soft I2C with arbitrary pins also works. The `sync` and `ack` wires provide
synchronisation and the `reset` line enables the Pyboard to reset the ESP8266
if it crashes and fails to respond.

I2C requires the devices to be connected via short links and to share a common
ground. The `sda` and `scl` lines require pullup resistors. The chosen ESP8266
pins are equipped with pullups on most boards. If for some reason external
pullups are needed, a typical value is 4.7KÎ© to 3.3V.

The I2C bus employed here cannot be shared with other devices.

A common power supply is usual but not essential.

# 2. Installation

A Python package is used so directory structures must be maintained.

#### On the Pyboard

These instructions assume an installation to the SD card. If installing to
flash, substitute `flash` for `sd` below.

On the Pyboard create a directory `/sd/micropython_iot`. Copy the following
files to this directory:
 1. `__init__.py`

Copy the directory `pb_link.py` to `/sd/micropython_iot`.

Start by issuing
```python
import micropython_iot.pb_link.pb_client
```

#### On the ESP8266

One option is to install the precompiled build. **TODO forthcoming**

Alternatively create a directory `/pyboard/micropython_iot`. Copy the following
files to this directory:
 1. `__init__.py`
 2. `client.mpy`

Copy the directory `esp_link` with its contents to `/pyboard/micropython_iot`.

Edit `/pyboard/main.py` to read:
```python
from micropython_iot.pb_link import pb_client
```

### Dependency

`uasyncio` is required on Pyboard and ESP8266. See the notes on this in the
[main readme](../README.md#31-installation).

# 3. Running the demo

On the Pyboard edit the file `/sd/micropython_iot/pb_link/config.py` to set the
WiFi credentials and the server IP address.

Ensure that the ESP8266 has been initialised with a WiFi connection or ensure
that the Pyboard's `local.py` has SSID and Password to enable it to connect.

On the server navigate to the parent directory of `micropython_iot` and run
```
python3 -m micropython_iot.pb_link.s_app
```

On the Pyboard run
```python
from micropython_iot.pb_link import pb_client
```

# 4. The Pyboard application

## 4.1 Configuration

There may be multiple Pyboards in a network, each using an ESP8266 with
identical firmware. The file `config.py` contains configuration details which
are common to all Pyboards which communicate with a single server. This will
require adapting for local conditions. The `config` list has the following
entries:

 0. Port (integer).
 1. Server IP (string).
 2. Server timeout in ms (int). Must == TIMEOUT in server's local.py.
 3. Send reports every N seconds (0: never) (`int`).
 4. SSID (str).
 5. Password (str).
 6. qos Quality of service (0 or 1). See [section 6](./README.md#6-quality-of-service).

If having a file with credential details is unacceptable an empty string ('')
may be used in the SSID and Password fields. In this case the ESP8266 will
attempt to connect to the WLAN which the device last used.

`config.py` also provides a `hardware` list. This contains `Pin` and `I2C `
details which may be changed. Pins are arbitrary and the I2C interface may be
changed, optionally to use soft I2C. The I2C interface may not be shared with
other devices. The `hardware` list comprises the following:

The `hardware` list comprises the following elements:
 0. `i2c`  The I2C interface object.
 1. `syn` A Pyboard `Pin` instance (synchronisation with ESP8266).
 2. `ack` Ditto.
 3. `rst` A Pyboard `Pin` instance (resets ESP8266).

## 4.2 Application design

The code should create a class subclassed from `app_base.AppBase`. The base
class performs initialisation. When this is complete, a `.start` method is
called which the user class should implement.

Typically this will launch user coroutines and terminate, as in the demo.

The `AppBase` class has `.readline` and `.write` coroutines which comprise the
interface to the ESP8266 (and thence to the server). User coros communicate
thus:

```python
    header, line = await self.readline()  # Read a \n terminated line from server app with user header
    await self.write(line)  # Write a line.
```
The `.write` method will append a newline to the line if not present. The line
should not contain internal newlines: it typically comprises a JSON encoded
Python object.

If the WiFi suffers an outage these methods may pause for the duration.

## 4.3 Special messages

The ESP8266 sends messages to the Pyboard in response to changes in server
status or under error conditions or because reports have been requested. Such
messages comprise JSON encoded lists where element[0] defines the message type:

 1. `['error', 'nature of error']` Error message.
 2. `['status', boolean]` Status message. This is sent whenever the server
 status changes at the start or end of a WiFi or server outage.
 3. `['report', nconnects, count, mem_free]` Report: sent at the requested
 interval.  
 `nconnects` Count of the number of times the ESP8266 has had to connect to the
 WiFi or  server.  
 `count` Incrementing report number (can be used to estimate  uptime).  
 `mem_free` Free memory on the ESP8266 (in bytes).

## 4.4 The AppBase class

Constructor args:
 1. `loop` The asyncio event loop.
 2. `conn_id` Connection ID. See below.
 3. `config` List retrieved from `config.py` as described above.
 4. `hardware` List retrieved from `config.py` defining the hardware interface.
 5. `verbose` Provide debug output.

Coroutines:
 1. `readline` Read a newline-terminated line from the server.
 2. `write` Write a line to the server. If a terminating newline is not present
 one will be supplied.
 3. `reboot` Physically reboot the ESP8266. The system will resynchronise and
 resume operation.

Methods:
 1. `close` Shuts down the Pyboard/ESP8266 interface.

If a WiFi or server outage occurs, `readline` and `write` coroutines will pause
for the duration.

The `conn_id` constructor arg defines the connection ID used by the server-side
application, ensuring that the Pyboard app communicates with its matching
server app. ID's must be newline-terminated and must not include other newlines.

Subclasses must define a synchronous `start` bound method. This takes no args.
Typically it launches user coroutines.

# 5. ESP8266 crash detection

The design of the ESP8266 communication link with the server is resilient and
crashes should not occur. But where 100% reliability is required and a reset
wire is in place there are two levels of crash recovery.

If I2C communication fails, the underlying
[asynchronous link](https://github.com/peterhinch/micropython-async/blob/master/i2c/README.md)
will reboot the ESP8266 and re-synchronise without the need for explicit code.
This caters for the bulk of potential failures and can be verified by pressing
the ESP8266 reset button while the application is running.

The truly paranoid should note that the ESP8266 I2C interface is handled in an
interrupt context. So certain types of failure will be undetected by this
mechanism: the ESP8266 might execute an infinite loop yet still respond to
interrupts and handle I2C communications.

This is heading into "highly unlikely" territory, but for bullet-proof recovery
`config.py` can be set to ensure that the ESP8266 sends periodic reports to the
Pyboard. The application could time the interval between reception of these
messages and, if the interval was excessive, issue `.reboot()`. A timer
suitable for this task is the
[Delay_ms class](https://github.com/peterhinch/micropython-async/blob/master/DRIVERS.md).

# 6. Quality of service

In the case where the user client application resides on the ESP8266 quality of
service in both directions is controlled at application level. This is detailed
[in this doc](https://github.com/peterhinch/micropython-iot/blob/master/qos/README.md).

Where the client application is on a Pyboard the behaviour of the ESP8266 in
messaging the server is determined by the config list.

The config list sent to the ESP8266 enables two levels of qos for messages from
the Pyboard to the server. Level 0 has no guarantee of message delivery. Level
1 indicates that the message will be delivered at least once but may be sent
twice if an outage occurs at the "wrong" time. **NOTE** Level 1 is not yet
working.

Achieving qos==2 (ignoring duplicates) may be performed at application level as
described in the above doc.

Specifying level 1 limits the throughput of messages to the server as the
transmission coroutine pauses for the timeout period after each message.

The QOS in the reverse direction is controlled by the server-side application.

Note that if the ESP8266 actually crashes all bets are off. The system will
recover but message loss may occur. Two observations:
 1. In my extensive testing crashes only occurred owing to electrical causes
 (a poor quality power supply).
 2. Guaranteed qos > 0 may be achieved at application level using response
 messages. When designing such a system bear in mind that response messages are
 themselves subject to non-guaranteed delivery.
