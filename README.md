# Introduction

This library provides a resilient bidirectional communication link between a
WiFi connected ESP8266 and a server on the wired LAN. The ESP8266 code can run
for indefinite periods. Temporary WiFi or server outages are tolerated without
message loss.

The API is simple and consistent between client and server applications,
comprising `write` and `readline` methods.

Thanks are due to Kevin KÃ¶ck for numerous contributions of code, ideas and bug
reports.

# 0. MicroPython IOT application design

IOT (Internet of Things) systems commonly comprise a set of endpoints on a WiFi
network. Internet access is provided by an access point (AP) linked to a
router. Endpoints run an internet protocol such as MQTT or HTTP and normally
run continuously. They may be located in places which are hard to access:
reliability is therefore paramount. Security is also a factor for endpoints
exposed to the internet.

Under MicroPython the available hardware for endpoints is limited. At the time
of writing (December 2018) the Pyboard D is not yet available. The ESP32 had
a fatal flaw which has [recently been fixed](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/issues/4269).
I haven't yet had the time to establish its level of general resilience.

The ESP8266 remains as a readily available inexpensive device which, with care,
is capable of long term reliable operation. It does suffer from limited
resources, in particular RAM. Achieving resilient operation in the face of WiFi
or server outages is not straightforward: see
[this document](https://github.com/peterhinch/micropython-samples/tree/master/resilient).
The approach advocated here simplifies writing resilient ESP8266 IOT
applications by providing a communications channel with inherent resilience.

The usual arrangement for MicroPython internet access is as below.
![Image](https://github.com/peterhinch/micropython-samples/blob/master/images/block_diagram_orig.png)

Running internet protocols on ESP8266 nodes has the following drawbacks:
 1. It can be difficult to ensure resilience in the face of outages of WiFi and
 of the remote endpoint.
 2. Running TLS on the ESP8266 is demanding in terms of resources: establishing
 a connection can take 30s.
 3. There are potential security issues for internet-facing nodes.
 4. The security issue creates a requirement periodically to install patches to
 firmware or to libraries. This raises the issue of physical access.
 5. Internet applications can be demanding of RAM.

This document proposes an alternative where the ESP8266 nodes communicate with
a local server. This runs CPython or MicroPython code and supports the internet
protocol required by the application. The server and the ESP8266 nodes
communicate using a simple protocol based on the exchange of lines of text. The
server can run on a Linux box such as a Raspberry Pi; this can run 24/7 at
minimal running cost.

![Image](https://github.com/peterhinch/micropython-samples/blob/master/images/block_diagram.png)  

Benefits are:
 1. Security is handled on a device with an OS. Updates are easily accomplished.
 2. The text-based protocol minimises the attack surface presented by nodes.
 3. The protocol is resilient in the face of outages of WiFi and of the server:
 barring errors in the application design, crash-free 24/7 operation is a
 realistic prospect.
 4. The amount of code running on the ESP8266 is smaller than that required to
 run a resilient internet protocol such as [this MQTT version](https://github.com/peterhinch/micropython-mqtt.git).
 5. The server side application runs on a relatively powerful machine. Even
 minimal hardware such as a Raspberry Pi has the horsepower easily to support
 TLS and to maintain concurrent links to  multiple client nodes. Use of
 threading is feasible.
 6. The option to use CPython on the server side enables access to the full
 suite of Python libraries including internet modules.

The principal drawback is that in addition to application code on the ESP8266
node, application code is also required on the PC to provide the "glue" linking
the internet protocol with each of the client nodes. In many applications this
code may be minimal.

There are use-cases where conectivity is entirely local, for example logging
locally acquired data or using some nodes to control and monitor others. In
such cases no internet protocol is required and the server side application
merely passes data between nodes and/or logs data to disk.

This architecture can be extended to non-networked clients such as the Pyboard.
This is forthcoming and is described and diagrammed
[here](./README.md#9-extension-to-the-pyboard).

# 1. Contents

This repo comprises code for resilent full-duplex connections between a server
application and multiple ESP8266 clients. Each connection is like a simplified
socket, but one which persists through outages.

# 2. Design

The code is asynchronous and based on `asyncio`. Client applications on the
ESP8266 import `client.py` which provides the interface to the link. The server
side application uses `server.py`.

Messages are required to be complete lines of text. They typically comprise an
arbitrary Python object encoded using JSON and terminated with a newline.

There is no guarantee of delivery of a message. Techniques to overcome this are
described in [section 7](./README.md#7-quality-of-service). Performance
limitations are discussed in [section 8](./README.md#8-performance).

## 2.1 Protocol

Client and server applications use `readline` and `write` methods to
communicate: in the case of an outage of WiFi or the connected endpoint, the
method will pause until the outage ends.

The link status is determined by periodic exchanges of keepalive messages. This
is transparent to the application. If a keepalive is not received within a user
specified timeout an outage is declared. On the client the WiFi is disconnected
and a reconnection procedure is initiated. On the server the connection is
closed and it awaits a new connection.

Each client has a unique ID which is stored in `local.py`. This ID enables the
server application to determine which physical client is associated with an
incoming connection.

###### [Contents](./README.md#1-contents)

# 3. Files and packages

 1. `client.py` / `client.mpy` Client module for ESP8266.
 2. `__init__.py` Functions and classes common to many modules.
 3. `server.py` Server module. (runs under CPython 3.5+ or MicroPython 1.9.4+)
 4. `examples` Package of a general example for client and server usage
 5. `examples_remote_control` Package demonstrating using the library to enable
 one ESP8266 to control another.
 6. `qos` Package of an example qos (qality of service) implementation, see
 [Quality of service](./README.md#7-quality-of-service).
 7. `pb_link` Package enabling a Pyboard V1.x to commuicate with the server via
 an ESP8266 connected by I2C. See [documentation](./pb_link/README.md).
 8. `esp_link` Package for the ESP8266 used in the Pyboard link.

`local.py` should be edited to ensure each client has a unique ID. Other
constants must be common to all clients and the server:
 1. `PORT` Port for socket communication.
 2. `SERVER` IP address of local server PC.
 3. `TIMEOUT` In ms. Normally 1500. See sections 6 and 7.
 4. `CLIENT_ID` Associates an ESP8266 with its server-side application. Must be
 unique to each client. May be any `\n` terminated Python string.
 The client and server configuration is done using constructor arguments, 
 therefore `local.py` is imported in the example files and can be implemented differently. 

## 3.1 Installation

This section describes the installation of the library and the demos on an
ESP8266 client.

#### Firmware/Dependency

It is recommended to use the latest release build of firmware as such builds
incorporate `uasyncio` as frozen bytecode. Daily builds do not. Alternatively
to maximise free RAM, firmware can be built from source, freezing `uasyncio`,
`client.py` and `__init__.py` as bytecode.

Note that if `uasyncio` is to be installed it should be acquired from 
[official micropython-lib](https://github.com/micropython/micropython-lib). It
should not be installed from PyPi using `upip`: the version on PyPi is
incompatible with official firmware.

If a daily build is used it will be necessary to
[cross compile](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/tree/master/mpy-cross)
`client.py`

#### Preconditions

Ensure the ESP8266 has a stored WiFi connection.

The file `local.py` on the client contains configuration data such as the
server port and IP address. It also contains a client ID which must be unique
to every client which is concurrently connected to the server.

Each demo directory contains a file `local.py` which will need to be adapted,
to match the local server IP address and possibly to change the default port.

Note that the server-side examples below specify `python3` in the run command.
In every case `micropython` may be substituted to run under the Unix build of
MicroPython.

#### File copy

This repository is built to be used as a python package. This means that on the
ESP8266 the directory structure must be retained.

The easiest way is to clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/peterhinch/micropython-iot micropython_iot
```
It's important to clone it into a directory *micropyhton_iot* as python does
not like packages that have a "-" character in their name.

On the ESP8266 a directory `/pyboard/micropython_iot` should be created and the
following files copied to it:
 1. `client.mpy`
 2. `__init__.py`
Note that the ESP8266 has insufficient RAM to compile `client.py` so the cross
compiled `client.mpy` must be used.

To install the demos the following directories and their contents should be
copied to `/pyboard/micropython_iot`:
 1. `qos`
 2. `examples`
 3. `example_remote_control`

This can be done using any tool but I recommend
[rshell](https://github.com/dhylands/rshell). If this is used follow these
commands:
```
rshell -p /dev/ttyS3  # adapt the port to your situation
mkdir /pyboard/micropython_iot   # create directory on your esp8266  
cp client.py __init__.py /pyboard/micropython_iot/
cp -r examples /pyboard/micropython_iot/
cp -r qos /pyboard/micropython_iot/
cp -r example_remote_control /pyboard/micropython_iot/
```

## 3.2 Usage

#### The main demo

This illustrates up to four clients communicating with the server. The demo
expects the clients to have ID's in the range 1 to 4.

On the server navigate to the parent directory of `micropython_iot`and run:
```
python3 -m micropython_iot.examples.s_app_cp
```
or
```
micropython -m micropython_iot.examples.s_app_cp
```
On each client edit the file `/pyboard/micropython_iot/examples/local.py` to
ensure that each has a unique ID in range 1-4. Run
```
from micropython_iot.examples import c_app
```

#### The remote control demo

This shows one ESP8266 controlling another. The transmitter should have a
pushbutton between GPIO 0 and gnd.

On the server navigate to the parent directory of `micropython_iot` and run:
```
python3 -m micropython_iot.example_remote_control.s_comms_cp
```
or
```
micropython -m micropython_iot.example_remote_control.s_comms_cp
```

On the esp8266 run (on transmitter and receiver respectively):

```
from micropython_iot.example_remote_control import c_comms_tx
from micropython_iot.example_remote_control import c_comms_rx
```

#### The qos demo

This test program verifies that each message (in each direction) is received
exactly once. On the server navigate to the parent directory of
`micropython_iot` and run:
```
python3 -m micropython_iot.qos.s_qos_cp
```
or
```
micropython -m micropython_iot.qos.s_qos_cp
```
On the client, after editing `/pyboard/qos/local.py`, run:
```
from micropython_iot.qos import c_qos
```

#### Troubleshooting the demos

On startup an `OSError` will be thrown if initial connectivity fails to be
established to the WiFi or to the server.

###### [Contents](./README.md#1-contents)

# 4. Client side applications

A client-side application instantiates a `Client` and launches a coroutine
which awaits it. After the pause the `Client` has connected to the server and
communication can begin. This is done using `Client.write` and
`Client.readline` methods.

Every client ha a unique ID (`MY_ID`) typically stored in `local.py`. The ID
comprises a newline-terminated string.

Messages comprise a single line of text; if the line is not terminated with a
newline ('\n') the client library will append it. Newlines are only allowed as
the last character. Blank lines will be ignored.

A basic client-side application has this form:
```python
import uasyncio as asyncio
import ujson
from micropython_iot import client
import local  # or however you configure your project


class App:
    def __init__(self, loop, my_id, server, port, timeout):
        self.cl = client.Client(loop, my_id, server, port, timeout, self.state, None)
        loop.create_task(self.start(loop))

    async def start(self, loop):
        await self.cl  # Wait until client has connected to server
        loop.create_task(self.reader())
        loop.create_task(self.writer())
        
    def state(self, state):
        print("Connection state:", state)

    async def reader(self):
        while True:
            header, line = await self.cl.readline()  # Wait until data received
            data = ujson.loads(line)
            print('Got', data, 'from server app')

    async def writer(self):
        data = [0, 0]
        count = 0
        while True:
            data[0] = count
            count += 1
            print('Sent', data, 'to server app\n')
            await self.cl.write(ujson.dumps(data))
            await asyncio.sleep(5)
        
    def close(self):
        self.cl.close()

loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
app = App(loop, local.MY_ID, local.SERVER, local.PORT, local.TIMEOUT, True)
try:
    loop.run_forever()
finally:
    app.close()  # Ensure proper shutdown e.g. on ctrl-C
```
If an outage of server or WiFi occurs, the `write` and `readline` methods will
pause until connectivity has been restored. The server side API is similar.

## 4.1 The Client class

Constructor args:
 1. `loop` The event loop.
 2. `my_id` The client id.
 3. `server` The server IP-Adress to connect to.
 4. `port` The port the server listens on.
 5. `timeout` The timeout for connection, used for connection state detection.
 6. `connected_cb` Callback or coroutine that is called whenever the connection changes
 7. `connected_cb_args` Arguments that will be passed to the *connected_cb* callback. First argument however is always the state.
 8. `verbose=False` Provides optional debug output.
 9. `led=None` If a `Pin` instance is passed it will be toggled each time a
 keepalive message is received. Can provide a heartbeat LED if connectivity is
 present.

Methods (asynchrounous):
 1. `readline` No args. Pauses until data received. Returns a line.
 2. `write` Args: `buf`, `pause=True`, `qos=True`. `buf` holds a line of text.  
 If `pause` is set the method will pause after writing to ensure that the total
 elapsed time exceeds the timeout period. This minimises the risk of buffer
 overruns in the event that an outage occurs.  
 By default, if `qos` is set, the system guarantees delivery. If it is clear
 messages may (rarely) be lost in the event of an outage. See
 [Quality of service](./README.md#7-quality-of-service).

Methods (synchronous):
 1. `status` Returns `True` if connectivity is present.
 2. `close` Closes the socket. Should be called in the event of an exception
 such as a ctrl-c interrupt.

Bound variable:
 1. `connects` The number of times the `Client` instance has connected to WiFi.

The `Client` class is awaitable. If
```python
await client_instance
```
is issued, the coroutine will pause until connectivity is (re)established.

The client only buffers a single incoming message. To avoid message loss ensure
that there is a coroutine which spends most of its time awaiting incoming data.

#### Initial behaviour

On startup the `Client` assumes that the ESP8266 has WiFi credentials for the
local network and the WiFi and server are up. An `OSError` will be thrown
otherwise. This behaviour may be modified, for example to connect with
credentials if the stored WiFi network is unavailable. To do this the `Cleint`
should be subclassed and one or both of the following asynchronous bound
methods overridden:

 1. `bad_wifi` No args. Awaited if WiFi can't connect in 4 seconds from boot.
 2. `bad_server` No args. Awaited if server refuses an initial connection.

Note that, once a server link has been initially established, these methods
will not be called.

###### [Contents](./README.md#1-contents)

# 5. Server side applications

A typical example has an `App` class with one instance per physical client
device. This enables instances to share data via class variables. Each instance
launches a coroutine which acquires a `Connection` instance for its individual
client (specified by its client_id). This process will pause until the client
has connected with the server. Communication is then done using the `readline`
and `write` methods of the `Connection` instance.

Messages comprise a single line of text; if the line is not terminated with a
newline ('\n') the server library will append it. Newlines are only allowed as
the last character. Blank lines will be ignored.

A basic server-side application has this form:
```python
import asyncio
import json
from micropython_iot import server
import local  # or however you want to configure your project

class App:
    def __init__(self, loop, client_id):
        self.client_id = client_id  # This instance talks to this client
        self.conn = None  # Will be Connection instance
        self.data = [0, 0, 0]  # Exchange a 3-list with remote
        loop.create_task(self.start(loop))

    async def start(self, loop):
        # await connection from the specific EP8266 client
        self.conn = await server.client_conn(self.client_id)
        loop.create_task(self.reader())
        loop.create_task(self.writer())

    async def reader(self):
        while True:
            # Next line will pause for client to send a message. In event of an
            # outage it will pause for its duration.
            header, line = await self.conn.readline()
            self.data = json.loads(line)
            print('Got', self.data, 'from remote', self.client_id)

    async def writer(self):
        count = 0
        while True:
            self.data[0] = count
            count += 1
            print('Sent', self.data, 'to remote', self.client_id, '\n')
            await self.conn.write(json.dumps(self.data))  # May pause in event of outage
            await asyncio.sleep(5)
        

def run():
    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    clients = {1, 2, 3, 4}
    apps = [App(loop, n) for n in clients]  # Accept 4 clients with ID's 1-4
    try:
        loop.run_until_complete(server.run(loop, clients, False, local.PORT, local.TIMEOUT))
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print('Interrupted')
    finally:
        server.Connection.close_all()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run()
```

## 5.1 The server module

This is based on the `Connection` class. A `Connection` instance provides a
communication channel to a specific ESP8266 client. The `Connection` instance
for a given client is a singleton and is acquired by issuing
```python
conn = await server.client_conn(client_id)
```
This will pause until connectivity has been established. It can be issued at
any time: if the `Connection` has already been instantiated, that instance will
be returned. The `Connection` constructor should not be called by applications.

The `Connection` instance:

Methods (asynchrounous):
 1. `readline` No args. Pauses until data received. Returns a line.
 2. `write` Args: `buf`, `pause=True`, `qos=True`. `buf` holds a line of text.  
 If `pause` is set the method will pause after writing to ensure that the total
 elapsed time exceeds the timeout period. This minimises the risk of buffer
 overruns in the event that an outage occurs. Does not preclude launching a
 further `write` coro if messages need to be sent in quick succession.  
 By default, if `qos` is set, the system guarantees delivery. If it is clear
 messages may (rarely) be lost in the event of an outage. See
 [Quality of service](./README.md#7-quality-of-service).

Methods (synchronous):
 1. `status` Returns `True` if connectivity is present.
 2. `__getitem__` Enables the `Connection` of another client to be retrieved
 using list element access syntax. Will throw a `KeyError` if the client is
 unknown (has never connected).

Class Method (synchronous):
 1. `close_all` No args. Closes all sockets: call on exception (e.g. ctrl-c).

The `Connection` class is awaitable. If
```python
await connection_instance
```
is isuued, the coroutine will pause until connectivity is (re)established.

The server buffers incoming messages but it is good practice to have a coro
which spends most of its time waiting for incoming data.

Server module coroutines:

 1. `run` Args: `loop` `expected` `verbose=False` `port=8123` `timeout=1500`
 This is the main coro and starts the system. 
 `loop` is the event loop. `expected` is a set containing the ID's of all clients. 
 `verbose` causes debug messages to be printed. `port` is the port to listen to
  and `timeout` is the amount of ms that can pass without a keepalive until the 
  connection is considered dead.
 2. `client_conn` Arg: `client_id`. Returns the `Connection` instance for the
 specified client when that client first connects.
 3. `wait_all` Args: `client_id=None` `peers=None`. See below.

The `wait_all` coroutine is intended for applications where clients communicate
with each other. Typical user code cannot proceed until a given set of clients
have established initial connectivity.

`wait_all`, where a `client_id` is specified, behaves as `client_conn` except
that it pauses until further clients have also connected. If `client_id=None`
the  assumption is that the current client is already connected. It waits until
a given set of clients have connected and returns `None`.

The `peers` argument defines which clients it must await. If `peers=None` the
coro pauses until all clients specified to `run` are also ready.  

If a set of `client_id` values is passed as the `peers` arg, it pauses until
all clients in the set have connected.

It is perhaps worth noting that the user application can impose a timeout on
this by means of `asyncio.wait_for`.

###### [Contents](./README.md#1-contents)

# 6. Ensuring resilience

There are two principal ways of provoking `LmacRxBlk` errors and crashes.
 1. Failing to close sockets when connectivity is lost.
 2. Feeding excessive amounts of data to a socket after connectivity is lost:
 this causes an overflow to an internal ESP8266 buffer.

These modules aim to address these issues transparently to application code,
however it is possible to write applications which vioate 2.

There is a global `TIMEOUT` value defined in `local.py` which should be the
same for the server and all clients. Each end of the link sends a `keepalive`
(KA) packet (an empty line) at a rate guaranteed to ensure that at least one KA
will be received in every `TIMEOUT` period. If it is not, connectivity is
presumed lost and both ends of the interface adopt a recovery procedure.

By default the `write` methods implement a pause which ensures that only one
packet can be sent during the `TIMEOUT` interval. This aims to ensure that
condition 2. above is met. However if more than one message is sent in quick
succesion, only the first will have low latency.

Calling `write` with `pause=False` fixes this but requires that the application
limits the amount of data transmitted in the `TIMEOUT` period to avoid buffer
overflow.

###### [Contents](./README.md#1-contents)

# 7. Quality of service

In MQTT parlance communication is at qos==2: there is a guarantee of packet
delivery. Messages sent will be received exactly once. However there is no
guarantee that they will be received in the same order. On occasion after an
outage, messages may be received out-of-order.

It is possible to turn this behaviour off by specifying `qos=False` to client
or server `write` methods. In this instance messages may occasionally be lost
if an outage occurs immediately before issuing `write`. With `qos` the mesage
would be sent when the outage cleared. The use-case for disabling `qos` is
where such a delayed message would be useless to the application

While delivery may be guaranteed, timeliness is not. Messages are inevitably
delayed for the duration of an outage.

The way in which qos is achieved is discussed [here](./qos/README.md).

###### [Contents](./README.md#1-contents)

# 8. Performance

## 8.1 Latency and throughput

The interface is intended to provide low latency: if a switch on one node
controls a pin on another, a reasonably quick response can be expected. The
link is not designed for high throughput because of the buffer overflow issue
discussed in [section 6](./README.md#6-ensuring-resilence). This is essentially
a limitation of the ESP8266 device.

In practice latency on the order of 100-200ms is normal; latency will of course
last for the duration if an outage occurs.

**TIMEOUT**

This is defined in `local.py`. Its value should be common to all clients and
the sever. It determines the time taken to detect an outage and the frequency
of `keepalive` packets. In principle a reduced time will improve throughput
however I have not tested values <1.5s.

## 8.2 Client RAM utilisation

With a release build the demo reports nearly 11KB free. Free RAM of 21.8KB was
achieved with compiled firmware with `client.py`, `__init__.py` and `uasyncio`
frozen as bytecode.

###### [Contents](./README.md#1-contents)

# 9. Extension to the Pyboard

This is a work in progress, working but needs further testing. It uses I2C to
link a Pyboard to an ESP8266. The latter runs a fixed firmware build needing no
user code. This extends the resilient link to the Pyboard. It uses the
[existing I2C module](https://github.com/peterhinch/micropython-async/tree/master/i2c).
